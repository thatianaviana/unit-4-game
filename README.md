Crystal Collectors!!!

A new guessing game using random numbers.

There are four crystals in the game which will have a random number between 1-12 and will refresh everytime someone loses or win. The amount of what each crystal is worth is not shown to the player.

The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game which is picked by the computer - the numbers are betweem 19-120.

When the player clicks on a crystal it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

The player wins the game if their total score matches the random number and if their total score goes higher than the random number the player loses. 

The number of games won/lost will be displayed and updated by each win/loss along with a message "You Won!!!" or "You Lost!!!" 

The game restarts by giving another random number and different numbers for the crystals without needing to refresh the page.
